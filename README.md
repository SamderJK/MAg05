MAg05 is a program that calculates stochastic operations based on challenge 5 of a [Matheon](https://www.matheon.de/index.php?&lang=en) math competition.


## Challenge
The challenge is linked [here](https://github.com/SamderJK/MAg05/blob/v1.0.1/airplane.pdf) but the whole document is written in German, so you may have to translate it for yourself.

### Information
* Santa has 22 days to choose an airplane which has enough capacity that he can store all his presents at one time. Only one plane fits that description but only the airline knows, what the maximum capacity is.
* He is offered one plane a day and he can either take it or not. The offer is only available for 24 hours.

### Strategy
